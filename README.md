# knockIE

Target specific IE version with JavaScript.

## About

Any Front End developer need to handle and support special browsers such is IE11, IE10, IE9, if he(she) unlucky also IE8 and if very unlucky IE7.
<br>
Mostly use of [conditional comments](http://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html) or lib such a [modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) pretty enough, but when u need handle specific version like a IE10 or IE11 knockIE can help you.
<br>
Just put it into your code and it will detect browser version and put browser class into root element.

![How it works](/demo/img/knockIE.png)

No inits. No dependencies. Just add it.

Can be used as alternative to conditional comments.


## Installation

    bower install knockie

or grab the [source version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godban/knockIE/master/dist/knockIE.js) or [minified version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godban/knockIE/master/dist/knockIE.min.js) and put it right before closing body tag or into head.

## Usage

Just add js file. That is it.
