Accessible Sidebar with Smart Scroll.

## About

There is different cases when you are using sidebar and often CSS just not enough to make it user friendly.
What scenarios you should be considered to make sidebar always accessible.

- ![Window color](/proto/window.png) W - Window
- ![Sidebar color](/proto/sidebar.png) S - Sidebar
- ![Content color](/proto/content.png) C - Content

| S >= C, S <= W, C <= W | S > C, S >= W, C <= W |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Simplest scenario when Sidebar greater or equal Content height and less than Window height. For this case is nothing be worried about, static position is pretty enough.![case 1](/proto/case1.png)  | Another static scenario is when Sidebar is greater than Content height and they both can be greater than window size. Scroll will be determinated by Sidebar height. ![case 2](/proto/case2.png)  |

| S < C, S <= W, C > W | S < C, S > W, C > W |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Sidebar is less than Content and Window heights. In this cases static position is not enough. Sidebar should be fixed to be always visible. ![case 3](/proto/case3.png) | And most complicated scenario is when Sidebar less than Content height and greater with Content than window size. In this case fixed position is not enough. Sidebar should be scrollable. ![Case 4](/proto/case4.png) |

To make it happen was created sidescroll.js plugin.
